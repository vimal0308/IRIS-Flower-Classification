In this project, we train the Machine Learning model with existing data, and when unseen data is encountered, the predictive model predicts the species based on what it has learned from the training data. This process not only enhances the accuracy and reliability of species identification but also demonstrates the practical application of supervised learning techniques. By leveraging scikit–learn’s robust set of tools and algorithms, we can efficiently preprocess the data, train various classification models, and evaluate their performance. Techniques such as cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature scaling are employed to optimise  the model’s predictive power. As different flower attributes and their species classification. Overall, the use of Machine Learning for IRIS flower classification showcase the potential of data-driven approaches in solving real- world problems and advancing our understanding of botanical species through automated analysis.
